# Milestones Project
This is a simple website created by Alexander as part of a Milestones assignment from *RevoU*.

It includes a personal background summary and highlights key projects from my learning journey.
The website is built using basic **HTML**, **CSS** and a **local Image**.

To run the project locally, clone the repository and open it in **VS code**. 
Then, use the **live server** extension to launch itin your browser.
